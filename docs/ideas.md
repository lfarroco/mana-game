# quests

Just like in wc3, quests are a way to give the player a goal to achieve. They
are usually given by NPCs, but can also be given by items or other events. We
can have a tab in the top bar that shows the current quests, and when you click
on one, it shows the description and the current progress.

# log

The log is a way to show the player what happened in the past:

- what quests were completed
- what items were picked up
- what items were dropped
- what items were crafted
- etc

- unit perks:
  - concentration: if not being attacked, the unit deals more damage
  - evasion: the unit has a higher chance to dodge attacks

- pool:
- heroes are unique, and once hired they are only available if dismissed
- then other players can hire that hero
- the number of items is also limited and shared, in the same way as heroes

turn every action type into a gimmick:

- on buy/sell item
- unit to the left/right/top/bottom of this
- on visit merchant/encounter/trainer
- on recruit/dismiss
- on start/end of fight
- on start/end of turn
- on poison/burn/bleed/freeze/haste/slow
- on heal/damage/crit/block/dodge/parry
- on doing x n times

targeting:

- unit to the left/right/top/bottom of this
- units around this
- all units
- all units of type
- all units of faction
- all units of class
- leftmost/rightmost unit
- isolated unit
- unit with lowest/highest hp/attack/defense/speed

do something based on another value:

- gain x as a percentage/double of y

stats that can be buffed:

- hp/attack/defense/speed
- sell price
- cri/dodge/parry/block chance

level up skills

- gain x income

merchants based on attributes

- sell economy/heal/attack/defense/speed items

create combinations with the events above:

- eg.: on x, the y something gets z

- allow learning skill on encounter reward
