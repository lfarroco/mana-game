# quests
Just like in wc3, quests are a way to give the player a goal to achieve. They are
usually given by NPCs, but can also be given by items or other events.
We can have a tab in the top bar that shows the current quests, and when you click
on one, it shows the description and the current progress.

# log
The log is a way to show the player what happened in the past:
 - what quests were completed
 - what items were picked up
 - what items were dropped
 - what items were crafted
 - etc 


- unit perks:
  - concentration: if not being attacked, the unit deals more damage
  - evasion: the unit has a higher chance to dodge attacks
