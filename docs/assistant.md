I'm designing a strategy rpg in the style of ogre battle.
I'm currently pondering about some problems in the mechanics.
Suppose that you have a map with multiple squads with heroes and enemy units on it.
When two squads collide, they engage in a battle.
When the battle is over, here's when problems emerge.
In ogre battle, if you defeat an enemy unit, it will start fleeing from your unit, and you just need to chase it down. there's little strategy involved in that.
to avoid this, I'm considering making fights go until a unit is completely defeated, but that would not be much fun.
any insights on what could be done?


Balancing the dynamics of unit engagements in a strategy RPG like Ogre Battle requires careful consideration of various factors to ensure strategic depth and player engagement. Here are some ideas to address the issues you mentioned:

Tactical Retreat Mechanism:
Rather than having defeated squads simply flee, you could introduce a tactical retreat mechanism. When a unit is on the verge of defeat, it might choose to retreat to a strategic position on the map. This could be a defensible location, a reinforcement point, or even a temporary sanctuary. The retreating unit might regain some health or receive reinforcements, requiring the player to plan their pursuit carefully.

Capture Mechanism:
Instead of outright defeating a unit, provide players with the option to capture enemy units. Once a unit is weakened, the player has the choice to attempt to capture some or all of the enemy units. This introduces an additional layer of strategy, as capturing units could provide valuable resources or information. However, the process of capturing could be risky, and failure might allow the enemy units to regroup.

Morale and Surrender:
Implement a morale system that influences the behavior of squads. When a unit's morale is low, they may be more likely to surrender rather than fight to the death. Morale could be influenced by various factors such as the presence of a strong leader, recent victories or defeats, and the overall situation on the battlefield. Surrendering squads could become neutral or join the winning side, adding an element of diplomacy to the game.

Dynamic Objectives:
Introduce dynamic objectives during battles. For example, instead of focusing solely on defeating enemy squads, certain battles might have secondary objectives, such as protecting a particular unit, capturing a strategic point, or completing a mission within a time limit. This encourages players to think beyond defeating the enemy and adds variety to the gameplay.

Reinforcement Mechanism:
Allow defeated squads to call for reinforcements. Instead of fleeing, a defeated unit might send a distress signal, prompting additional enemy units to arrive on the battlefield. This creates a sense of urgency for the player to finish off weakened squads quickly before reinforcements tip the balance.

Terrain and Environmental Factors:
Incorporate terrain and environmental factors that can influence the outcome of battles. For example, squads might have a higher chance of survival if they retreat to a forested area or a fortified position. This adds a strategic layer to battles, as players must consider the geographical features of the battlefield.

By combining some of these mechanics, you can create a dynamic and engaging system that goes beyond the simple defeat-and-flee model, encouraging players to think strategically and adapt to the ever-changing conditions of the battlefield.

does heroes of might and magic has a retreat system?

Yes, the Heroes of Might and Magic (HoMM) series does have a retreat system. In Heroes of Might and Magic games, when a hero engages in combat with an enemy army on the adventure map, players have the option to fight the battle or retreat. The retreat option allows the player's hero to avoid the battle and move away from the enemy army.

The retreat mechanism in Heroes of Might and Magic is a tactical choice that players can make based on factors such as the strength of their army, the enemy's army, and the terrain. Retreat can be a strategic decision to avoid a difficult battle, regroup, or seek a more advantageous position.

It's worth noting that the retreat system in HoMM is different from the scenario you described in Ogre Battle, where defeated squads flee and need to be chased down. In Heroes of Might and Magic, the retreat option is under the control of the player and can be used strategically to manage the progression of the game.

would it be more interesting having units in each unit have its own hp, and be able to die individually, or having a morale system that would decrease with each unit defeat?

Both individual unit health and a morale system can contribute to interesting and strategic gameplay, and the choice between them often depends on the specific experience you want to create in your strategy RPG. Let's explore the potential benefits and considerations for each approach:

Individual Unit Health:
Pros:

Granular Strategy: Individual unit health allows for a more detailed and granular level of strategy. Players can make decisions about which units to prioritize for healing or protection.

Realistic Consequences: Losing individual units can have a more realistic impact on the overall strength and capabilities of a unit. It can also create emotional connections between players and specific units.

Dynamic Battles: Battles become dynamic as units are lost or weakened. Players may need to adapt their tactics on the fly, considering the changing composition of their unit.

Cons:

Micro-management: Individual unit health can lead to increased micro-management, especially with larger squads. Players might find it challenging to keep track of and manage the well-being of each unit.

Punishing for Mistakes: Losing units in battle could be more punishing, potentially discouraging players, especially if losing a critical unit significantly impacts their overall strategy.

Morale System:
Pros:

Strategic Depth: A morale system adds an extra layer of strategic depth. As morale decreases, squads may become less effective, making it important for players to consider the psychological aspect of warfare.

Dynamic Battles: Similar to individual unit health, a morale system can contribute to dynamic battles. Squads with low morale might be more susceptible to various negative effects, creating interesting tactical opportunities.

Less Punishing: Losing a battle doesn't necessarily mean losing individual units. Instead, it affects the overall effectiveness of the unit. This can make the game more forgiving for players who make mistakes in battle.

Cons:

Abstraction: Morale is an abstract concept, and some players may prefer a more concrete representation of unit strength and damage.

Predictable Outcomes: Morale systems, if too straightforward, might lead to predictable outcomes. Once a unit's morale is low, the result of the battle might be more certain, potentially reducing suspense.

Hybrid Approach:
You could also consider a hybrid approach that incorporates elements of both individual unit health and a morale system. This allows for a balance between granular strategy and overall unit effectiveness.

Ultimately, the choice between individual unit health and a morale system depends on your design goals, the level of complexity you want in your battles, and the kind of player experience you aim to deliver in your strategy RPG. Consider playtesting both systems with a focus group to gather feedback and determine which approach resonates best with your target audience.

would it be a good idea having each unit with its own "morale" and "stamina" counters? what effects would high/low values of these counters have?

Having both "morale" and "stamina" counters for each unit in your strategy RPG is an interesting idea that can add depth and nuance to the gameplay. The combination of morale and stamina introduces a dual-layered system, each affecting different aspects of the unit's performance. Here are some potential effects of high and low values for these counters:

Morale:
High Morale:

Increased Combat Effectiveness: High morale boosts the combat abilities of the unit. This might result in increased damage output, higher accuracy, or enhanced special abilities.

Resistance to Negative Effects: Squads with high morale could be more resistant to debuffs or status ailments. They might shake off the effects more quickly or be less affected by enemy attempts to demoralize them.

Positive Interactions: High morale might lead to positive interactions within the unit, such as better coordination or teamwork. This could result in combo attacks or shared abilities.

Low Morale:

Decreased Combat Effectiveness: Low morale negatively impacts the unit's combat capabilities. Units might deal less damage, have lower accuracy, or be more prone to making mistakes.

Increased Vulnerability: Squads with low morale could become more susceptible to enemy tactics. They might be easier to flank, suffer from lowered defenses, or be more likely to succumb to negative status effects.

Risk of Rout: Extremely low morale might increase the risk of the unit routing or surrendering, potentially affecting the overall outcome of the battle.

Stamina:
High Stamina:

Sustained Performance: High stamina ensures that the unit can maintain its peak performance for an extended period. This could be reflected in a reduced likelihood of fatigue-related penalties.

Ability to Maneuver: Squads with high stamina might have increased mobility on the battlefield, allowing them to reposition more easily or take advantage of the terrain.

Quick Recovery: High stamina enables squads to recover more quickly between battles, making them ready for subsequent engagements sooner.

Low Stamina:

Fatigue Penalties: Low stamina could result in penalties to combat effectiveness, accuracy, or other attributes as units become fatigued.

Reduced Mobility: Squads with low stamina might be slower on the battlefield, making them more vulnerable to being outmaneuvered by more agile opponents.

Extended Recovery Time: Low stamina increases the time needed for the unit to recover between battles, making them more susceptible to consecutive engagements.

Strategic Interplay:
The interplay between morale and stamina creates strategic depth. For instance, a unit with high morale but low stamina might start a battle strong but become increasingly vulnerable as the fight progresses. Conversely, a unit with high stamina but low morale might be able to endure multiple battles but struggle to maintain effectiveness.

Adjusting these factors dynamically throughout the course of the game or specific scenarios can add a layer of unpredictability, encouraging players to adapt their strategies based on the changing conditions of their squads.


in ogre battle, when a unit is defeated the game is paused and the defeated unit is pushed away from the winner. if a unit collides with another enemy while being pushed, a new battle doesn't trigger until the push is over.
I find it very unrealistic, and this push mechanic sometimes creates strange results.
I also find it very unlikely that a winner unit would let the enemy retreat freely like that.
how could we address this?

To address the unrealistic and potentially frustrating aspects of the push mechanic in Ogre Battle, you can consider alternative approaches that maintain strategic depth and immersion. Here are a few ideas:

1. Immediate Pursuit:
Rather than pushing defeated units away and allowing them to retreat freely, the winning unit could immediately pursue the defeated unit. The game could transition seamlessly into a pursuit phase, where the winning unit chases down the defeated one. This eliminates the awkwardness of the push mechanic and gives players more control over the pursuit.

2. Zoning Mechanism:
Implement a zoning mechanism that prevents defeated squads from freely retreating. When a unit is defeated, it enters a "retreat zone" where it cannot move freely. The winning unit can then strategically position itself to cut off escape routes, forcing the defeated unit to either surrender or engage in another battle.

3. Surrender Mechanism:
Introduce a surrender option for defeated squads. Instead of the automatic push and retreat, defeated squads could have the choice to surrender, potentially sparing some or all of their units. The winning unit would then decide whether to accept the surrender or pursue for complete elimination.

4. Capture Mechanism:
As mentioned earlier, implement a capture mechanic where the winning unit has the option to capture some or all of the defeated units. This adds a layer of strategy to the post-battle phase, as players must decide whether to pursue, capture, or allow the defeated unit to escape.

5. Dynamic Terrain and Obstacles:
Introduce dynamic terrain and obstacles on the battlefield that influence the post-battle phase. For example, defeated squads could seek refuge in forests, cities, or other strategic locations. The winning unit would then need to navigate the terrain to continue the pursuit, creating more varied and interesting scenarios.

6. Reinforcement and Ambush:
Consider scenarios where defeated squads can call for reinforcements during a retreat. This adds an element of risk to pursuing squads, as they might encounter additional enemy forces during the pursuit. It also discourages players from mindlessly chasing down every defeated unit.

7. Decision Points:
Provide decision points during the pursuit phase. For example, the winning unit might come across a fork in the road, and players must choose the direction to pursue. Different paths could lead to different outcomes, such as capturing the enemy leader, discovering hidden resources, or encountering new challenges.

By incorporating one or more of these alternatives, you can create a more dynamic and immersive post-battle experience that aligns with player expectations and enhances the overall strategic depth of your strategy RPG. Playtesting different approaches with your target audience can help you fine-tune the mechanics for the best balance of realism and engaging gameplay.
